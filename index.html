                <h2>Internet for Generation Beta- Blockchain</h2>
                <div class="displayonstart">
                    <pre>      The future of the Internet has been the 
subject of much speculation and debate in the 
past few years. From the rise of virtual worlds
and immersive experiences to the explosive 
growth of social media, the internet has
become a ubiquitous medium for
communication and commerce With the rise
of blockchain, theinternet is about to go
through a major transformation. <hr class="thematicbreak">
         This isn’t the first transformation
of the internet. Since its public emergence
nearly 30years ago, the internet has gone
through two major evolutions and is about to go 
through a third. These transformations not only have 
changed how we use the internet and what we use it 
for, but they have impacted the world at large, changing 
how we live and work and interact with others. <hr class="thematicbreak">    
      The descendants of gen z so called generation Beta would be born in blockchain world, the word
blockchain would replace internet and as generation passes humans will have their upgraded versions
of blockchain not Internet. As u can say blockchain is the new networking the prospect of the word 
internet would hold no value.

                <h2>The Invisible Technology That's Changing the World</h2>
                <p> Blockchain-based networks, decentralized apps (DApps), and distributed ledgers are becoming the
                    foundation of much of your digital life. There's a new immutable digital fabric remaking the
                    internet beneath us, and you probably don't even realize it.
                    <hr class="thematicbreak">
                    Blockchain isn't a household buzzword, like the cloud or the Internet of Things. It's not an
                    in-your-face innovation you can see and touch as easily as a smartphone or a package from Amazon.
                    But in a world where anyone can edit a Wikipedia entry, blockchain is the answer to a question we've
                    been asking since the dawn of the internet age: How can we collectively trust what happens online?
                    <hr class="thematicbreak">
                    <img src="blockchainworld.jpg" class="blockchainworld" alt="Blockchain World">

                    Every year we run more of our lives—more core functions of our governments, economies, and
                    societies—on the internet. We do our banking online. We shop online. We log into apps and services
                    that make up our digital selves and send information back and forth. Think of blockchain as a
                    historical fabric underneath recording everything that happens—every digital transaction; exchange
                    of value, goods and services; or private data—exactly as it occurs. Then the chain stitches that
                    data into encrypted blocks that can never be modified and scatters the pieces across a worldwide
                    network of distributed computers or "nodes."
                    <hr class="thematicbreak">
                    Think about a blockchain as a distributed database that maintains a shared list of records. These
                    records are called blocks, and each encrypted block of code contains the history of every block that
                    came before it with timestamped transaction data down to the second. In effect, you know, chaining
                    those blocks together. Hence blockchain.
                    <hr class="thematicbreak">
                    A blockchain is made up of two primary components: a decentralized network facilitating and
                    verifying transactions, and the immutable ledger that network maintains. Everyone in the network can
                    see this shared transaction ledger, but there is no single point of failure from which records or
                    digital assets can be hacked or corrupted. Because of that decentralized trust, there's also no one
                    organization controlling that data, be it a big bank or a tech giant like Facebook or Google. No
                    third-parties serving as the gatekeepers of the internet. The power of blockchain's distributed
                    ledger technology has applications across every kind of digital record and transaction, and we're
                    already beginning to see major industries leaning into the shift.
                    <hr class="thematicbreak">

                    First up are the big banks and tech giants. Big business will always drive innovation, and the rise
                    of blockchain-based smart contracts (read on for a deeper explanation) turns blockchain into a
                    middleman to execute all manner of complex business deals, legal agreements, and automated exchanges
                    of data. Companies such as Microsoft and IBM are using their cloud infrastructure to build custom
                    blockchains for customers and experiment with their own use cases, like building a worldwide food
                    safety network of manufacturers and retailers. On the academic side, researchers are exploring
                    blockchain applications for projects ranging from digital identity to medical and insurance records.
                    <hr class="thematicbreak">

                    At the same time, dozens of startups are using the technology for everything from global payments to
                    music sharing, from tracking diamond sales to the legal marijuana industry. That's why blockchain's
                    potential is so vast: When it comes to digital assets and transactions, you can put absolutely
                    anything on a blockchain. A host of economic, legal, regulatory, and technological hurdles must be
                    scaled before we see widespread adoption of blockchain technology, but first movers are making
                    incredible strides. Within the next handful of years, large swaths of your digital life may begin to
                    run atop a blockchain foundation—and you may not even realize it.

                <h3>Blockchain - Prespective through my inverted image
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Human brains have to manage an inconceivably massive amount of information. By current estimations,
                    we
                    are offloading, transferring, and storing information upward of 2.5 quintillion bytes a day.In this,
                    humans require a trustable mechanism for recalling and telling their story. And such technology
                    could
                    enable the betterment of the human species.
                    <hr class="thematicbreak">

                    To this end, there is a growing interest in the convergence of IoMT (Internet of Medical
                    Technology), self-adjusting algorithms optimising central nervous system patterns, and a smart
                    ledger of quantifiable human record. Among the companies at the forefront are Elon Musk’s Neuralink,
                    Bryan Johnson’s Kernel, and the award-winning Silicon Valley company Neuropace. These teams are
                    using technology to sense, analyze, and respond to changes in brain behaviour. And their work poses
                    a foundational opportunity to augment the human brain’s ability to recall memories, make smarter
                    decisions, and objectively learn about consciousness
                </p>
                <img src="synapses.png" alt="secure and connected world" class="synapse">
                <hr class="thematicbreak">
                <p> Imagine wearable devices or neural implants capturing data that will enable a vastly profound
                    understanding of human consciousness; and algorithms that determine the importance of a memory and
                    “prune” it to improve cognitive or motor function. Imagine an immutable, objective record of human
                    experience in place of subjective histories.
                    <hr class="thematicbreak">

                    This is where blockchain technology comes in. Blockchain technologies in conjunction with neural
                    implants will be capable of capturing and encoding thoughts, providing smart ledgers to represent
                    human experience data logging.
                    <hr class="thematicbreak">
                <h3>Brain on Blockchain</h3>
                Blockchains are a form of information technology with several important future applications capable of
                supporting brain augmentation. One proposal is the storing of mindfiles, which would act as building
                blocks of data in personal thinking chains, shareable in a peer-to-peer network file system that allows
                historical versioning. This type of Blockchain thinking is proposed as an input-processing-output
                computational system with several features that lend opportunity for artificial intelligence, human
                enhancement, and their potential integration.
                <hr class="thematicbreak">
                Blockchain allows an interconnected network of computers to shake hands at intervals of a timestamp to
                validate the source and truth of a ledger. If we were to build a brain from the ground up, this type of
                trust mechanism could enable nets of neurons to store and recall information with accuracy and trust of
                what is subjective versus an objective of a given experience.
                <hr class="thematicbreak">
                The multi-factor authentication connecting to a personal thinking chain as a blockchain implementation
                can enable opportunity for the safe building of a quantified-self data commons for human beings. Such a
                data-commons reduces the siloes of human data, while also allowing for each human to keep ownership over
                the privacy or sharing of their experience, possibly to garner monetary benefit without the use of a
                third party or centralised authority.
                <hr class="thematicbreak">
                At some future date using an augmented version of this technology, when two or more people experience
                the same moment, though from subjective perspectives, we could reassemble their experiences to be more
                objective about the happenings of that moment. Ideally, this would enable the creation of virtual
                simulations for past memories, and the potential to see subjectively from someone else’s perspective.
                Once we have a better elastic understanding of individual mappings to emotions and sensory experiences
                as contributive to a given memory, this would take in data from the senses onto this future blockchain –
                like sight, smell, etc.
                <hr class="thematicbreak">
                And the fact is, the technologies to make this a reality are being developed. In the not-so-distant
                future, we can begin recording our sensory experiences by the use of wearable technology, the current
                state of brain and nerve implants, biofeedback imaging, and any other sensors that permit a multi-factor
                fingerprint specific to a given human’s record of temporal experience. Using these technologies as a
                starting point, research can be performed into improvement of decision making, learning, recall, and
                rehabilitative protocols.
                <hr class="thematicbreak">
                <h3>Mindware</h3>
                Somewhere along this way in parallel, we would want to compile memory after memory into an understanding
                of experiential ability, so that we could create mindware – i.e., software built upon the premise of
                experiential understanding of a given human’s subjective experiences. Mindware would be composed of
                mindfiles, uploaded, interconnected, and shared in a peer-to-peer network file system.
                <hr class="thematicbreak">
                High accuracy mind clones could then be built as an additional layer, and we could create entire virtual
                simulations of experiences past, current, or entirely separate from temporal reality (though with
                similar physical and thermodynamic laws as our current shared reality). Our mind clones could act on our
                behalf to garner additional experience, ability, or even perform jobs that supplement our immutable, yet
                exponential record of life as it passes through the generations.
                <hr class="thematicbreak">
                Memories would not be the only realm we would want an immutable ledger of, though. Biochemical
                exchanges, drug interactions, rehabilitative progress, and even testing a hyper-speed-like learning of
                new abilities are all forms of an immutable record that could benefit our understanding of the brain and
                the overall functioning of the central nervous system.
                <hr class="thematicbreak">
                What if our brain’s plasticity drove our expert software systems? What if the exponential augmentation
                of such an implementation allowed thought computation to perceive the implications of one decision as it
                progresses thousands of years into the future? By connecting the computation of our biology with the
                unfathomable world of data we currently have and will share, our very perception of time and our impact
                upon time would disintegrate and reintegrate into a new awareness of our conscious ability to evolve
                intelligently by the design that we collectively choose.
                <hr class="thematicbreak">
                Through merging with self-adjusting artificially intelligent algorithms and the fusion of wetware and
                intelligent software, we could drive an exponential enhancement of human capability, giving us
                previously unimagined capabilities to rewrite genetic code, single neurons, overall brain circuitry, and
                biochemical patterns. It could make possible interaction with external environmental sensors, autonomous
                machines, and even other conscious beings, manipulating the temporal sensory experience and our
                surrounding environment in parallel.

                <hr class="thematicbreak">
                <p class="bottom"> Highly complex obstacles, of course, do remain. As a society, we must first attempt
                    to agree on the
                    sort
                    of society we want to build. We need to revisit consensus models for societal change and seek to
                    understand the reward systems dictating social behaviour. Together we must decide on a standardised
                    approach to the betterment of our species, designing these new technologies in such a way that they
                    may
                    serve to motivate according to principles of collective altruism – rather than egocentric or
                    materialistic values. Only reaching these consensuses, and building technologies accordingly, can we
                    stave off undesirable consequences and assist in the advancement of humankind.
