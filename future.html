                <h3>Internet for generation beta</h3>
                <p>
                    It is with no doubt that generation beta would be born in the blockchain world and inculating this
                    technology from the very young age of being born would lead to next level humans adults, or if just
                    making the use of the incredible digital-technological environment they have can also lead to lazy ,
                    unemployed humans with no emotions enslaved by the technology but themselves, it is true that the
                    surroundings that generations is going to imbibe will lead to extreme human behaviourial changes but
                    in way that is not predictable.
                    <hr class="thematicbreak">
                    Millennials on the otherhand can be the leader of this technological revolution, the fact that
                    Millennials have experienced pre-Digital age, The information age & now The blockchain age with all
                    other tech innovations like AI, IOT, going hand by hand and will be the living truth of how
                    surroundings effect human behaviourism and evolution.
                    <hr class="thematicbreak">

                <h3>Humans vs Technology</h3>

                As humans, we are lazy and we take cognitive shortcuts. Misplacing our trust in machines is a mistake
                that all of us are capable of doing."
                <hr class="thematicbreak">
                Humans are bad at paying attention, at being aware of their surroundings and at performing under
                pressure. And yet, the idea behind driverless cars is that the human monitor should step in
                at the last possible moment and operate at peak performance, at the moment where it matters the most.
                <hr class="thematicbreak">
                We should only use algorithms as long as we can trust humans to
                overrule them when necessary.The solution, lies in adopting a "human-centric"
                approach when developing new technologies; in other words, an approach that accounts for human flaws.
                The need to "partnership" between humans and machines that could combine the best
                of both – while also ensuring that there is always space for humans to question the algorithm's
                <hr class="thematicbreak"> One where we acknowledge, when deploying new technology, that it's not only
                machines that
                have flaws, but that humans do too.
